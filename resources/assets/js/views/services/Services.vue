            <ul>

Phoenix Shanti Group therapists are also trained in an evidence-based trauma treatment called EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing).

            <h3>Group Counseling</h3>

            <p>Phoenix Shanti Group offers an intensive outpatient program focused on substance use/abuse and HIV support/education. This program consists of multiple group sessions held at our clinic throughout the week. This program is for HIV+ individuals.</p>

            <p>Group members discuss and process a variety of issues including exploring relationships, improving self-esteem, relapse prevention, mental health concerns, HIV-related issues, stress management, and enhancing coping skills.  Group members are encouraged to share information about themselves and provide feedback to others. Group leaders aim to create a safe and supportive environment, which includes facilitating productive communication and respect. Group leaders may also encourage member engagement in the group process, give feedback, and offer support to individual members or the group as a whole. Group facilitators will also provide education surrounding common themes experienced by group members. Group members are asked to make a commitment to protect each other’s confidentiality by agreeing not to share information that would identify other members outside of group.</p>

            <p>At Phoenix Shanti Group, we have found that many experience relief from participating in  group treatment and recognizing that they are not alone in facing life’s challenges. Often, substance use can lead to isolation. Group participation allows individuals to re-engage in social settings and learn how to build healthy connections with others. Many members have also found it helpful to be able to learn from peers’ experiences and have shared that seeing others recover creates a sense of hope.</p>

            <h3>Vocational Rehabilitation / Job Skills Training</h3>

            <p>PSG, through a 7,000 sq. foot re-sale store, provides a three module Voc Rehab curriculum program for trainees to gain knowledge, skill, and experience to re-enter the workforce.</p>

            <p>Trainees learn “hard skills” like computer use, internal inventory controls, donation pickup scheduling, organization, maintenance, pricing and item values, furniture repair and display, customer service, point of sale and money handling, workforce expectations, work ethics, and more.</p>

            <p>Trainees also learn “soft skills” like communication, boundaries, assertiveness training, problem solving, decision making, self-esteem, risk taking, value clarification, conflict resolution and more.</p>

            <p>Additionally, trainees learn how to create a resume, how to search for employment and receive interview coaching. It is our hope that by providing a long term solution thru education and training, individuals will be more likely to become self-sufficient and independent in the future.  We strive for a goal of either job placement or enrollment in a higher education institution by the time the trainee is ready to graduate from the program.  The Vocational Rehabilitation program is a 1 year program for most participants but can be extended further on a case by case basis.</p>

            <p>Shanti’s Second Chances thrift store and Voc Rehab program is an integral part of the Phoenix Shanti recovery experience. It is available to all clients of the Phoenix Shanti Group.</p>

            <p>Shanti’s 2nd Chances store is located at 4015 N 16th Street Phoenix, AZ, and is open Monday through Friday 9am – 6pm and on Saturday 9am-5pm. You can also shop from our Ebay store, ebay.com/usr/phoenix-shanti-group</p>
