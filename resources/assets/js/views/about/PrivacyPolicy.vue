                <h3>Information We Gather and Track</h3>

                <p>We gather two types of information about users:

                <p>1. Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions and can include to sign up as a user, receive electronic newsletters, fill out response forms, participate in polls, etc.</p>

                <p>2. Information we gather through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs.</p>

                <p>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent.</p>

                <h3>Usage Tracking</h3>

                <p>We track user traffic patterns throughout all of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. We do break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information passed to us by every user's browser).</p>

                <p>We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better site for you.</p>

                <h3>Cookies</h3>

                <p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it can enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. But the only personal information a cookie can identify is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies to track users who've signed-in and people who've participated in a poll.</p>

                <p>You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site.</p>

                <h3>Use Of Information</h3>

                <p>As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in the various parts of our site. Otherwise, we do not share your e-mail address or any other individually identifying information with any third parties.</p>

                <p>While we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas, we do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.</p>

                <p>We create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for our internal use only. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>

                <h3>Sharing Of The Information</h3>

                <p>We will not sell, trade, rent or provide any information about individual users with any third party, except to send out electronic newsletters or to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>

                <h3>Security</h3>

                <p>We use servers protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users.</p>

                <h3>Opt-Out Policy</h3>

                <p>We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Opting not to register as a user and receive our electronic newsletters.</li>

                    <li>Opting not to participate in certain interactive areas, which completely alleviates the need to gather any personally identifiable information.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Data Quality and Access</h3>

                <p>The accuracy of your individual identifying information is important to us. Registered users can review their individual identifying information by signing in and following the instructions.</p>

                <h3>Linked Sites</h3>

                <p>We provide links to other sites. The privacy policies of these linked sites are the responsibility of the linked site and we have no control or influence over their policies. Please check the policies of each site you visit for specific information. We cannot be held liable for damage or misdoings of other sites linked or otherwise.</p>

                <h3>Your Consent</h3>

                <p>By using this site, you consent to our collection and use of this information you provide.
