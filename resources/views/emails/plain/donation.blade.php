Dear {{ $firstName }},

The Phoenix Shanti Group would like to thank you for your generosity. Your monthly recurring donation of ${{ number_format(($amount / 100), 2) }} has begun. The Phoenix Shanti Group is an Arizona Non-Profit 501(c) (3) Corporation which was founded in 1987.  Our mission is to provide housing, education and patient services to people infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS.

Donations are fully tax deductible as allowed by tax law.

You can cancel anytime by emailing info@shantiaz.org. We will soon be building a member portal for your convenience so you can manage your donation subscription. We thank you for your patience while this is built.

Thank you again for acknowledging the important work we are doing in the continued struggle against HIV disease and AIDS, and for your generosity.
Your kind gesture will make a significant impact on the self-worth of a patient in our homeless shelter program.

We really appreciate your thoughtfulness.

In Love and Light,
Keith Thompson
